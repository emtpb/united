******

United tries to represent SI-units as optimal as possible by resolving "smaller" units into "bigger" units
via a look up table and supports various arithmetic operations between unit objects.

Example:
    Creating a unit with Volt V as a numerator and Ampere A as denominator will result into the
    unit Ohm Î©. Same goes for creating two separate units Volt and Ampere and dividing Ampere from Volt.
